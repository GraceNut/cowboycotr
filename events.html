						<h1>Christian Based Fellowship</h1>
						<p>We know how families are looking to enjoy their animals and get out of the house so we encourage good clean fun and fellowship (muddy boots are acceptable) that is non-offensive to others around you including families with young children. We are convinced that there is plenty of fun to be had.</p>

						<p>The Young'ins can enjoy some fun while you participate in the event. They can even ride for FREE! We have volunteers who allow others to ride their fine horses. These Wranglers will lead first timers around the arena on their horses and instruct more experienced riders on their horsemanship. Other fun-filled activities may include: chicken chases, roping contests, sack races, prizes and more! In the future, horsemanship lessons and other events will be offered.</p>
