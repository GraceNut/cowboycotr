								<h1>The Holy Scriptures</h1>
								<p>We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, equally in all parts and in the whole and is totally inerrant in the original manuscripts. We further believe it is the supreme revelation from God and of God, superior to conscience and reason, though not contrary to them; and it is therefore our infallible rule in all matters. We believe that all Scriptures center about the Lord Jesus Christ and hence that no portion is properly read nor understood until it leads to Him.</p>
								<cite>John 5:39; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 1 Peter 1:23-25; Hebrews 4:12</cite>

								<h1>The Godhead</h1>
								<p>We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and that these three are one God, having the same nature, attributes and perfection, and are worthy of the same homage and obedience.</p>
								<cite>Matthew 28:18-29; Mark 12:20; John 1:14; Acts 5:3-4; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Hebrews 1:1-3; Revelation 1:4-6</cite>

								<h1>The Lord Jesus</h1>
								<p>We believe in the pre-existence, incarnation and virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ who came into the world to reveal the Father, and was the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person; that the Lord Jesus Christ was the Creator of all things, for by Him the worlds were made. We believe that in Christ dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and that He was all God and all man, the I AM, the Jehovah of the Old Testament. We further believe in the sinless life of our Lord Jesus Christ, His Miracles, His vicarious and atoning death, His bodily resurrection, His bodily ascension into Heaven, and in His coming again as revealed by the Scriptures.</p>

								<h1>The Holy Spirit</h1>
								<p>We believe that the Holy Spirit though omnipresent from all eternity, after the glorification of Jesus Christ was sent on the day of Pentecost, dwells in every believer, unites all to Christ in one body, and is the source of all power and acceptable service. We believe that the work of the Holy Spirit includes the restraining of evil in the world; the convicting of the world in regards to sin, righteousness, and judgment; the regeneration of all believers; the sealing of all believers unto the day of redemption; and the continuous filling for power and service of these among the saved who are yielded to Him and to His Will. We believe that the fruit of the spirit is the manifestation of the character of Christ in the believerÂ’s life. We further believe that all the gifts of the Spirit should be and must be operative in the church for the church to manifest her full glory under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.</p>

								<h1>Angels, Heavenly and Fallen</h1>
								<p>We believe that God created an innumerable company of sinless spiritual beings known as angels; the one, identified in scripture as "Lucifer", sinned through pride, thereby becoming Satan; that a company of the angels followed him in his moral fall and have now become demons and are active as his agents in opposing all that is godly, holy and united in building the kingdom of God.</p>
								<cite>Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel 28:11-19; 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6</cite>
								<p>We believe that Satan is the originator of sin, and that, under the permission of God, he, through subtlety, led our first parents into transgression, thereby accomplishing their moral fall and subjecting them and their posterity to his own power and that he is the enemy of God and His people. However, we also believe that Satan was defeated by Jesus Christ at Calvary, through the bodily resurrection of our Lord Jesus, and that Jesus delegated this authority over Satan to His body, the Church, and to each born again Christian in the church. At the return of Jesus Christ to the earth, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss for a thousand years, and after the thousand years he will be loosed for a little season and then cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where he shall be tormented day and night forever and ever throughout eternity.</p>

								<p>We further believe that a great company of angels kept their holy estate and are before the Throne of God, from whence they are sent forth as ministering spirits, flames of fire, to minister to those who are heirs of salvation and who hearken to the voice of God to do His bidding.</p>

								<h1>The Creation of the World and Man</h1>
